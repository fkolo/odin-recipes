       <p>This is a kale salad that's super easy to make and extremely delicious. Also, don't <br>
        worry about sticking to the recipe; it's super easy to add or omit ingredients. It<br>
        would go great with chicken or beans or you can even substitute parsely for the <br>
        cilantro (for all those people with that cilantro gene). <br> 
        </p>
